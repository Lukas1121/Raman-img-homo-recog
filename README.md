# Raman-img-homo-recog
ROI detection for microscopy images prior to Raman imaging+

If you wish to test this code, just run the run.py in the main project directory. This will run the code on the blind test microscopy image under the same
conditions as described in the essay. 

If you have some other microscopy images you wish to test this script on simply specify a new path leading to the folder containing them. Or to be safe,
copy and paste them into the same directory "Raman/Blind_test".

This repository will of course remain open until the exam has been held.
